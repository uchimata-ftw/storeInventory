# storeInventory
I work at a liquor store and I wrote this to make counting our inventory go faster. 
Outputs everything to text files and sorts by types of liquor.
Pretty basic and self explanitory, I got faith in you.
Just made for personal use but I am releasing it using the GNU public license in case anybody else could use it.
