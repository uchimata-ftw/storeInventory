# storeInventory

I work at a liquor store and I wrote this to make the inital count of our inventory go faster. 
Outputs everything to text files and sorted by type of liquor and includes a total of entire inventory.

Made for personal use and to learn how to use git and github, but I am releasing it using the GNU public license in case anybody else could use it.

Compile and run from the terminal
